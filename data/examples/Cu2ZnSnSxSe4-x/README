The example generates Table VII in:
Dun, C., Holzwarth, N. a W., Li, Y., Huang, W., & Carroll, D. L. (2014). 
Cu2ZnSnSxO4-x and Cu2ZnSnSxSe4-x: First principles simulations of optimal 
alloy configurations and their energies. 
Journal of Applied Physics, 115(19). 
doi:10.1063/1.4876447

It will list the different configurations and their mutiplicity for different values of x.
Supercell should be installed. Run script df_cfg.bash The order of table rows will not be the same as in the paper.

The supercell commands used in this work are of the form:

supercell -i stannite.cif -s 1x1x1 -p "S:p=3" -p "Se:p=5" -m -o [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]/stannite

in which the populations of S and Se atoms on crystallographic sites "S" and "Se" (note that "S" and "Se" in the -p option refer to crystallographic labels rather than to atom symbols. More typical labels would be of the form "S1" and "Se1"). The multiplicity of this site in the cell being 8 and the supercell size being 1x1x1, the population values "p" should obey:
p(S) <= 8
p(Se) = 8 - p(S)
