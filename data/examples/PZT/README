Description:
The example generates FIG 3 (left) in paper

Grinberg, I., Cooper, V. R., & Rappe, A. M. (2004). 
Oxide chemistry and local structure of PbZrxTi1-xO3 studied by 
density-functional theory supercell calculations. 
Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, 69(14), 1â€“17. 
doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.69.144118

Instructions:
Supercell should be installed. Run script df_cfg.bash

Results:
The figure is directly printed in the terminal.

**********************************
Additional notes:
The supercell commands used in this example are of the form:

supercell  -s 4x2x1 -i PZT-PbZr05Ti05O3.cif -m -o out/PZT421

Note, that the generated and reference table items ordered differently.
