Unpack all files to any folder. Below this folder will be referred as 
<supercell_folder>.
After that you have three options.
1) Run supercell program from the folder.
   ./supercell -i /path/to/input/file ... -o /path/to/output/folder
2) Do "export BABEL_DATADIR=/full/path/to/<supercell_folder>" ones for each 
   shell session (each login). After that, you can run supercell in any 
   folder with command
   /path/to/<supercell_folder>/supercell -i input_file ...
3) Add to .bashrc (if your are using bash shell) line 
   "export BABEL_DATADIR=/full/path/to/<supercell_folder>" and 
   don't "export" each time you login to your system.
